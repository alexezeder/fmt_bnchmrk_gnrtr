## Generator of [{fmt}](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) benchmark results

This project creates the nice output for [fmt_bnchmrk](https://github.com/alexezeder/fmt_bnchmrk) - just 
[check it out](https://alexezeder.github.io/fmt_bnchmrk).

### How to run

**First of all, I strongly recommend you to not run this project on your machine yet. You can run it at your own
risk, of course, but please read this entire file.**

These packages should be installed in your system:

* `git`
* `python3` and `python3-pip` and `python3-venv`
* `docker`
* `sqlite3`

Use `venv` and `pip` to install dependencies without polluting system.
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r /generator/requirements.txt
```

Current workflow of the `main.py` script (which is the entrypoint by the way):

* clone fmt_bnchmrk
* clone {fmt} repo
* initialize docker and build all runners from `runners` folder (currently only `gcc-11`)

  _this step is creating docker images (names are "fmt_bnchmrk:<runner_name>") in your system, be prepared_

* prepare SQLite DB for the current config
* while one of last 100 commits of {fmt} or newer:
  * run task in docker for this commit
  * upload results to fmt_bnchmrk Pages

You may wonder why there are `-j2` placed all over the runners' files, or maybe even why does this project process
one commit per time, why not all the commits simultaneously ðŸ™‚. The answer is the PC that runs this code
and produces Pages for fmt_bnchmrk - it's Raspberry Pi 3B. Yep, with 1GB RAM (the main reason) and 4 not-so-fast cores.
But actually, I was impressed how does this board manage to handle Python, Docker, and compilation of templated code via
GCC, simultaneously.

The choice of Raspberry Pi for such tasks may seem strange, but it's:

* standalone, thus give me pretty consistent results, unlike some VPSs or background task on utilized PC
* that's all I have, I don't have an unused PC for tasks like this
* Raspberry PI is finally in use, hooray, because last time it was in use was with
  [RetroPie](https://github.com/RetroPie) but as it turned out, I'm not a big fan of retro games
